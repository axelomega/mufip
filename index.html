        <h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>I have not so far found a good library for
	fixed point arithmetics in C++ that is usefull for
	bitmunipulation and also integrate well with normal C++ types.</p>

	<h3>Intended Structure</h3>

	<p>This library should support fixed size signed and unsigned
	integeras as well as signed and unsgiend fractional
	numbers. It might even include a signed unlimited bitfield
	type. All types should be interoperable with eachother in
	arithmetich expressions with deterministic results and type
	resolutions.</p>

	<h3>Bit Operations</h3>

	<p>An important aspect of the library is
	to be able to support bit and bit field operations as is done
	in e.g. Verilog or VHDL.</p>

	<h3>Help Out?</h3>
	<p>If you are interested in taking part in this project do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
